      <h1>Getting started with FPV</h1>
      <p>
        So, you have made up your mind and want to try FPV? Like many things in
        life your FPV journey is exactly that - <strong>YOUR JOURNEY</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So how you do things is entirely up to you and there surely is more than
        one way to accomplish certain milestones on your way to becoming a
        decent FPV drone pilot.
      </p>
      <p>
        FPVtips's goal is to share those different paths. For instance, some
        people prefer to spend more hours on a simulator before they try the
        real thing. Others find the simulator boring. You do you!
      </p>
      <p>Here are some resources that could help you on your journey.</p>
