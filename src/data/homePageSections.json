      "FPV means First Person View and refers to the perspective or point of view when flying a FPV freestyle or a racing drone (quadcopter). Pilots use goggles to receive a live video feed, transmitted from the drone's camera which also translates into a 'flying from the cockpit' feeling.",
      "As a broader term, FPV is an awesome fast-paced hobby, allowing you to fly drones (quads), planes, wings using a radio transmitter and enjoying the out of body experience through the first person view camera.",
      "Have a look at this video to get an idea, but don't let my poor flying skills fool you and definitely checkout some of these excellent, excellent pilots:"
